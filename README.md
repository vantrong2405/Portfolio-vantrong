## 🏗️ Architectural Core

The project has been refactored from a multi-scene state machine into a **Single-Page Scrolling Architecture**, prioritizing user flow and performance.

### ⛓️ Key Technologies
- **Frontend Engine**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling Architecture**: Tailwind CSS 4.0 (Modern utility-first system)
- **Fluid Motion**: Framer Motion (Orchestrating scene transitions and micro-interactions)
- **Atmospheric Layer**: Custom Canvas-based Interactive Mesh + CSS Scanline effects
- **Internationalization**: i18next (Robust multi-language support: VI/EN)

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Unbounded Hero**: Removal of traditional card-based containers to create an "infinite" system feel.
- **Portals & Masks**: Massive, masked imagery that blends seamlessly into the atmospheric background.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Distinct professional categorization between **Backend Engineering** and **DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure**.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Interactive glowing indicators, glitch typography, and floating tech insignia.
